# CloudIoTCoreMQTTExample

Found it hard to understand the docs here: https://cloud.google.com/iot/docs/how-tos/mqtt-bridge and no examples online, so wrote my own.

Using MQTT to talk between an AndroidThings board and Cloud IoT Core Pub/Sub


Based on the example here:

https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/java-docs-samples/blob/master/iot/api-client/mqtt_example/src/main/java/com/google/cloud/iot/examples/MqttExample.java

but written for AndroidThings instead of Java. Also tried to keep it simpler and separated.
